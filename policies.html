Some of these service providers, and links to their opt-out tools, are:  Google Analytics: with a privacy policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ and opt out at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.  Industry Opt Out Tools: Some Advertising Service Providers or providers of Tracking Tools may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), and you can opt-out of certain services and learn more about your choices by visiting the links included here.

The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service. We collect certain persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the Service.

If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.  Opting-out of Behavioral Advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. It only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests. You may continue to see ads on and about the Service.</p>

In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, enforce our agreements, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally. If you wish to change or delete your profile and Personal Data, you can contact us at privacy@Gongong.com, and we will amend or delete your Personal Data within a reasonable time after your request, if feasible, or if you reside in the EU, as set forth in Section 8 below. Because of the crowd-sourced and collaborative nature of our service, however, we will not be able to delete content you post to public areas of our site. We may be able to anonymize your information such that you will no longer be reasonably identifiable. 7. TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</p>

						<p>The Service is hosted and operated in the Republic of South Africa (&ldquo;S.A.&rdquo;) through Gongong and its service providers, and if you are not located in S.A., laws in S.A. may differ from the laws where you are located. By using the Service, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Gongong in S.A. and will be hosted on S.A. servers, and you authorize Gongong to transfer, store and process your information to and in S.A., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to S.A. pursuant to EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, the details of which are further set forth below.</p>

						<p>Gongong has been certified to the EU-S.A. Privacy Shield Framework set forth by S.A. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and use of Personal Data transferred from the EU. For more information about the Privacy Shield Program, and to view Gongong&rsquo;s certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov. Gongong is committed to the Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability, with respect to all Personal Data received from within the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Gongong&rsquo;s compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of S.A. Federal Trade Commission.</p>

						<p>Please contact us at gdpr@Gongong.com with any questions or concerns relating to our Privacy Shield Certification. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield-related complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, you can also resolve a Privacy Shield-related complaint through JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the Republic of South Africa. You can visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you can also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means. 8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</p>

						<p>As noted in the Terms of Service (https://Gongong.com/static/terms), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 (or if you are in the EU, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16). If you are under 13 (or under 16 in the EU), please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13 (or under age 16 in the EU), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 (or under 16 in the EU) may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at privacy@Gongong.com. Please contact us at privacy@Gongong.com if you have any questions about children's privacy. 9. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</p>

						<p>The Service, from time to time, contains links to and from third party websites of our partner networks, advertisers, partner merchants and retailers.

						<p>Welcome to the services operated by Gongong Live Media (PTY)Ltd (&quot;Gongong,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), consisting of the website available at Gongong.com, the Gongong Live website available at live.Gongong.com (&quot;Gongong Live&quot;) and the other online and/or mobile services, websites and software provided by Gongong (collectively the &quot;Service&quot;). By accessing or using the Service, you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;), signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Gongong Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, &quot;Terms&quot;) and to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in our Privacy Policy, as modified from time to time and which is incorporated by reference herein. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (&quot;Users&quot;).</p>

						<p>If you are a Republic of South Africa Federal Agency, this Amendment is applied to the Terms of Service.</p>

						<p>We provide the Service for your use subject to the Terms. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post a notice at the top of our Service for a period of seven (7) days. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acknowledgement of, acceptance of, and agreement to the revised Terms. You agree to periodically visit this page to review the current Terms so you are aware of any revision to which you are bound. We will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Service.</p>

						<p>Additional terms and conditions may apply to certain components or features of or provided via the Service (including Gongong Live), and you agree that you shall be subject to any such terms that may be posted via the Service or otherwise made available to you from time to time. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>

						<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>

						<p>THE SERVICE MAY CONTAIN CONTENT THAT IS INACCURATE, OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN, OR OTHERWISE UNSUITED TO YOUR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT Gongong SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU ALLEGE IN INCUR AS A RESULT OF ANY EXPOSURE TO SUCH CONTENT.

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at privacy@Gongong.com. Please note that if you are located in the European Union, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under 16, so if you are a child under 16 and you are located in the European Union, you should not attempt to register for the Service or send us any Personal Data.</p>

						<p>Copyright Complaints: Gongong respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify Gongong of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure below.</p>

						<p>As set forth in our Copyright Policy, Gongong will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Gongong' DMCA Agent at dmca@Gongong.com (Subject line: &quot;DMCA Takedown Request&quot;). You may also contact us by mail at:</p>

						<p>Gongong 123 Botanic Gardens Road, Berea, Durban, South Africa</p>

						<p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>

						<p> an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;  a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;  a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site or Service, with enough detail that we may find it on the Service;  your address, telephone number, and email address;  a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law;  a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner&lsquo;s behalf.</p>

						<p>Counter-Notice: If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>

						<p> your physical or electronic signature;  identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;  a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and  your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the Republic of South Africa, for any judicial district in which Gongong may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint or an agent of such person.</p>

						<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Gongong will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or User, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

						<p>Repeat Infringer Policy: In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Gongong has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Gongong's sole discretion, Users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

						<p>Third Party Websites and Content</p>

						<p>The Service contains (or you may encounter through your use of the Service) links to other web sites operated by third parties (&quot;Third Party Sites&quot;) as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, sound, video, information, and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties (the &quot;Third Party Content&quot;). Such Third Party Sites and Third Party Content are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Third Party Sites accessed through the Service or any Third Party Content posted on, available through the Service, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices or other policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or the Third Party Content. Inclusion of, linking to or permitting the use of any Third Party Site or any Third Party Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by Gongong. If you decide to leave the Service and access the Third Party Sites or to access or use any Third Party Content, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that our terms and policies (including our privacy policy) no longer govern your use of such Third Party Sites.

						<p>Gongong is not responsible for cookies, web beacons, clear gifs, or other code you or any third parties place on your computer or device in any way, including any association of Service content with such code. For example, if you access a Third Party Site through a link on the Service, your browser or other cookies on your computer may cause a referrer header to be sent to that site indicating some of your browsing history or the URL from which your visit originated. Gongong shall have no liability to you in connection with any such transmission, whether or not that transmission contains information associated with or originating from Gongong.</p>

Gongong EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

						<p>FEDERAL LAW, SOME STATES, PROVINCES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF CERTAIN IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

						<p>Limitation of Liability</p>

						<p>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Gongong SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Gongong HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA BY ANY PARTY; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; (V) YOUR USER CONTENT; OR (VI) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE. IN NO EVENT SHALL Gongong' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID Gongong IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, FIFTY Rands (R50).</p>

						<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>

						<p>The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the Republic of South Africa. Gongong makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable Republic of South Africa and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the Republic of South Africa, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the Republic of South Africa government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

						<p>Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</p>

						<p>Governing Law: You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 S.A.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York, New York for any actions for which Gongong retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that New York, New York is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>

						<p><b>Arbitration</b>: READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Gongong. For any dispute with Gongong, you agree to first contact us at terms@Gongong.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Gongong has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, &quot;Claims&quot;), by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York, unless you and Gongong agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Gongong from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Gongong's proprietary interests.</p>

						<p>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver: WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Gongong ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>

						<p>Termination</p>

						<p>In addition to the termination rights set forth elsewhere herein, you agree that Gongong, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content (including without limitation your User Content) within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Gongong believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Gongong may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Gongong may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Gongong shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>

						<p>User Disputes</p>

						<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other User in connection with the Service and Gongong will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Gongong reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other User of the Service or to elect to display only certain of the User content submitted in connection with a particular Gongong subdomain.</p>

						<p>Assignment</p>

						<p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Gongong without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>

						<p>General</p>

						<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Gongong and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Gongong with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use certain features of the Service, affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. The failure of Gongong to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred, unless required otherwise by applicable law. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
